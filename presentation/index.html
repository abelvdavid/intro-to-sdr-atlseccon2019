					## Introduction to Software Defined Radio ( SDR ) 
					Gurjeet Clair - @Toxic_Flange

					http://github.com/gclair/

					<img class="plain" src="images/crazyGurjeet.png" style="width: 300px">
					Note:  This is an introduction to software defined radio, not a deep dive, and easy on the technical detail. 
					The intent of this talk is to inform you about a field of research that you may not have known about or wasn't aware
					that it is more affordable than ever before. 
					--
					## WARNING
					<img class="plain" src="images/h0us3s_Signs_Hazard_Warning_33.png" style="width: 200px" >

					THIS IS NOT AN  "#INFOSEC" TALK.  

					Note: The things i'll talk about today don't really relate to infosec IMO, in a practical way (exceptions). If you are 
					just interested in all things tech,  or wanting to expand on your bad ass hacking skills, this is, I hope, the talk for you. 
					If I do it right, I may have introduced you to a potentially expensive hobby. Amateur Radio guys can attest to that. 
					--
					###  Fellow Nerds
					- SCADA/ICS/DSP people
					- HAM Radio oldies (not in age, just experience)

					Note: If you work with RF stacks or do anything with (DSP) you probably know about this 
					field, and some of the tools. Maybe I'll introduce you to a new tool, or say something abhorrently 
					incorrect, please stand up and correct it!

					## Why should I care about radios?
					<img src="images/Gentleman-Hacker-radio.jpg" >
					Nevil Maskelyne - radio scientist/magician
					Note: We use them every day, for the majority of the functions in our lives. As hackers or aspiring hackers, learning about 
					the world around us, how it functions and how to alter it is empowering.. and fun.. sometimes a bit naughty. Amateur Radio,
					like hacking, is about using radio technology to do what you want, and making technology work the way that you want it to so that 
					you can accomplish whatever goals you have. Besides some of your favourite hackers are Hams (like The Wozniak), astronauts, 
					journalists are amateur radio operators. Hated marconi, his broad patents, marconi made a claim his radio was secure.. woo.

					## Software Defined Radio (SDR)
					...  is a radio communication system where components that have been traditionally implemented in hardware 
					(e.g. mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a 
					personal computer or embedded system. - Wikipedia

					Note: Traditionally you got a radio based service with a device made specific to that service and nothing else. If you have an
					AM radio or version 1/2 of a Wifi device, you needed to buy a new device (AM/FM radio,Wifi ver X) to use the new shiny faster,
					higher fidelity service. Or a whole new device for a different type of service (Zigbee, Z-wave,Bluetooth)
					--
					<img src="images/SDR_et_WF.png">
					Software Defined Radio Scheme - Adopted by LtCdr 
					Topi Tuukkanen, Project Manager, Finnish Software 
					Radio Demonstrator from various scientific articles,
					studies, conference papers etc in public domain. 
					Note:  SDR shifts those hard wire/hard coded components that mix, filter, amplify, modulates or demoodulates into an FPGA or to
					your computer. 
					--
					## Remember these? Example of software defined 'things'
					<img src="images/WinModemXRegModem.jpg" style="width: 800px">
					Note: To let some of you who weren't born in the 70's or 80's (weird i know they exist and are here), remember the transition
					from 'real' or 'hardware' modems to WinModems or SoftModems? This is am example of offloading a hardware function to software.
					-- 
					# Still got one!

					## History
					SPEAKeasy Phase I and II

					<img src="images/speakeasy.jpeg" style="width: 600px">
					Note: Multiple parallel creation stories, independant but all working to the same goal. Raytheon was working on a software based
					transciever for a GSM base station in 1991 and modified the idea and sold it to the US Airforce who had a project called SPEAKeasy, 
					the goal of which was to combine 10 radio systems into one. Sort of succeeded, was size of a truck. Amateur radio and HF radio engineers
					realized the value of digitizing and were experiementing with DSP's from the 80s to 90s, finally German Aerospace Center (DLR)
					created an full transceiver SDR in 1988. 
					--
					## Today-ish
					<img src="images/Today-Icon.jpeg" style="width: 600px">
					Note: Fast forward to the early 2000's to today. There were commercial versions of SDRs created but they are in the hundred to 
					thousands of dollars and came with propietary software. 
					--
					## SDR for the masses 
					<img src="images/DVB-T_USB_dongle_with_RTL2832U_and_R820T.jpg" style="width: 600px">
					Note: Eventaully real hackers discovered that a Digital Video Broadcast (DVB-T) device had the
					capability to be tuned to a larger frequency range than designed. This control allowed these devices to receive other RF ranges, 
					feed the data to the software. After that there was purpose made radio devices for SDR making it easier to play with and here we 
					are.
					---
					# Capabilities and Projects, Use Cases

					Note: Sneaky data exfiltration, slow scan TV, DVB-T tv, DAB audio, FM audio, GSM (2G) traffic decoding, IMSI catcher, Cellphone
					shenanigans (Defcon NinjaTel), amateur radio/Ham radio, packet radio (AX.25), vehicle tracking via APRS, Airplane tracking ADS-B, 
					listening to airline traffic (ACARS), tracking ships in the harbour,listening to city services on trunked radio (not the cops..yet), 
					, speaking with ISS, downloading NOAA weather images, Amateur radio astronomy, home automation projects, passive and active weather 
					radar, RF direction finding, potential to infiltrate the 'connected' smart city grid. GPS tracking, faking GPS.
					Depending on the RF front end capabilities and your antenna.
					--
					### Exceptional Application
					<img src="images/threatmodelman.jpg" style="width:600px">
					Note: Remember the exceptions mentioned earlier. A 'blueteam' wouldn't necessarily use these tools, a red-team might
					if their target involves RF accessible ICS/SCADA systems. If you're a developer of an application that uses RF like perhaps 
					a traffic control system or city wide mesh network from SilverSprings Networks/Itron, you might use this for RF Fuzzing.   
					Not all network stacks are made equal (Win vs Linux vs BSD TCP), not all RF platforms are either like Zigbee/Zwave(Philips hue).
					---
					## Hardware
					<img src="images/SDRes.jpg" style="width: 600px">
					Note: Easiest way to get started is with the RTL-SR.COM v3 kit. This is a receive only device but works in the 24 Mhz to 1766
					Mhz range (direct sampling mode is 500khz to 24Mhz, ham radio frequencies). Be careful of the device you buy, there's cheaper
					but you get what you pay for. NooElect devices are good too. Digikey will become your sears christmas wishbook. Get SMA connected
					devices. MCX and all others are a pain. Airspy are reputable devices too. 
					--
					## Transmitting
					<img src="images/LimeSDR-side.jpg">
					Note: If you want good clean transmitting devices, HackRF, LimeSDR, Ettus USRP. Can be cost prohibitive. I've got LimeSDR Mini, 
					inexpensvie and a high learning curve but about 150-200 canadian. Will go for MIMO later. 
					-- 
					## Fun hacks
					<img src="images/fl2k_devices.jpg">
					Note: Cheapest and most inaccurate way to get into transmitting (also potential violation of Industry Canada rules), RPi can be
					modified into a transmitter, as well as some "USB 3.0 to VGA" adapters. 
					--
					## Antennas
					<img src="images/Waifu-Antenna-Front.png" style="width: 600px">
					Note: this is the waifu antenna from @ifnotpike on twitter. Smart dog lots of great learning resources through him.
					--
					<img src="images/NotPikeWaifuAntenna.png" style="width: 400px">
					--
					<img src="images/Antennas.jpg" style="width: 600px">
					Note: Location matters, you can't do this from the basement office without having a cable run to an antenna HIGH up (attic), outdoors 
					if possible. Old Fashioned rabbit ears (dipoles) work well for most of what you'll probably start out with. Tiny ADS-B antennas 
					are primarily good for one application and will frustrate you once you grow out of tracking airplanes. 
					--
					<img src="images/AntennaConnectors.jpg" style="width: 600px">
					Note: Top two antenna connectors are SMA style. Look like F-Type connectors thats on your cable TV. (you still got that right?) They
					aren't compatible. When picking a device, make a digikey order for a lot of SMA male and female connectors because you'll make 
					pigtails (cable adapters or extenders) or just buy them off Amazon.
					--
					<img src="images/QuestionableAntenna.png">
					Note: Just about anything can be an antenna and however silly it looks, if its in a better position than your radio and you, use it.
					 Emergency Dipole, cable split. 
					--
					## No money for this fancy thing?
					  * not that expensive or fancy really
					<img src="images/PCBPlanarDiskAntenna.jpg" style="width: 300px">
					Note: Planar disk antenna. 

					--
					## No problem
					Embrace hacker ethos, DIY!
					<img src="images/Pizza-Dishes-Antenna.jpg" style="width: 300px">
					Note: dollar store purchase, Betty Crocker wideband and broadband antenna.. Experiments were ok, but i wasn't high enough to properly
					test it. Going in attic. Don't wanna do it, wife will make me do other chores.

					-- 
					# Others
					<img src="images/radioforeveryone-bottleantenna.jpg">
					Note: you can spend a long time on antenna and design. It was a lot of fun learning about them, for me. 
					--
					## Skillsets and extra tools
					Learn to solder or make good friends who solder well.
					<img src="images/CracklinCrotchDipole.png">
					Note: I was in a bind, needed parts and my high school friend Cracklin Crotch' (SNL reference) helped me out with parts and soldering.
					Be careful of the online handles you choose when younger.. its weird when older (but still very funny).

					## OS / Software
					<img src="images/gnuradio.svg" style="width: 600px">
					<img src="images/wide_logo_pothosware.png" style="width: 600px">
					Note: lots of software out there, to program with and just to see frequencies in a scope and waterfall. GQRX, SDRAngel, SDRSharp 
					(airspy) to visually scan with. OS wise, I use a Ubuntu derivative. Even though you'll hate it, Ubuntu is probably your best bet
					for software compatibility. Lots of Windows supported applications too.

					--
					# GQRX
					<img src="images/gqrx.png">
					Note: this has the aprs decoder and great way to test your radio if its working properly.

					--
					# SDRSharp
					<img src="images/sdr-sharp.png">
					Note: Windows support.
					--- 
					# Programming
					Note: Lots of ways to develop and program your own SDR application, this is the basic way to get started and familiar.
					--
					# GNURadio
					<img src="images/gnuradiocompiling.png" style="width: 1800px">
					<img src="images/gnuradio.svg">
					Note: Use PyBombs, its all Python2 based and will recompile from source and place extensions in a location of your choosing. 
					Takes forever but best if you don't want weird software libraries all over the place that are incompatible with each other
					leading to frustration.
					--
					# PothosWare SoapySDR
					<img src="images/pothoswareoverview.png" style="width: 600px">
					Note: Another flowgraph based software is called Pothosware. Haven't used it much, however I have used SoapySDR, which is a set of
					libraries that act as a software abstraction layer to driving the RF hardware and is used for most other applications that need an
					RF frondend.

					# Application specific
					Note: Dump1090, sdr-trunk, GQRX - APRS , data exfiltration, URH reversing. Smart grids.
					--
					# Track airplanes
					<img src="images/dump1090.png" style="">
					Note: ADS-B software, flightaware sticks, only thing mostly.
					--
					## SDR-Trunk 
					Note: SDR Trunk allows you to listen to local services, not the police, its encrypted. play video if time. Thank @obihann/Jeff Hann

					## Reversing radio protocol
					<img src="images/URH.png">
					Note: Universal Radio hacker , discover modlation keying and protocol necessities
					--
					## Reversing the easier way
					SilverSpring Networks/Itron
					<img src="images/PhotoCell-SilverSprings-MAC.jpg">
					Note: this is outside my house.. and yours.. and even yours probably.

					# Ending.. or a beginning. 
					Get your ham license!

					# Be curious!
					Note: Find a group to work with. Shared learned experiences and failures are a lot more fun.
